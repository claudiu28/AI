On this day I saw the best of God, which is not in vain. I was surrounded by all sorts of people, but only by my own kind, and one thing was clear: In the Christian religion I had never seen an image of God. And while it was true that God had created the world, he never saw a human being. We were made of a single human being, made of a variety of people, and God never saw the man. God had made all things the way they are. Then he saw a man, and a woman, and a child, and a king. And God never saw anything like what we do today, and that is in the body. So I could see God alone and I could see Him as being on the line of the cosmos, but not as being the whole of the universe. In this way God was no different from men, and there was nothing strange about the fact that he had made man. And God himself is the man, and he is the God of all men. It is not necessary to think of men as a man or a God, that is, to think of God as the divine and the divine being. The creation, he explained, is nothing but an image of the divine being, which is the image of the truth and of God, or God being man and being God.\"\n",
